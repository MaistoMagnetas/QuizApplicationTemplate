Appliction has DB from which it takes shuffled questions. Each question has three answer from which only one is correct.
Correct - means that score + 1 will be added to question target, which is hold in DB and Question object.
If user avoid all correct answers, random answer will be printed. Also, if two answer has the same value one will be chosen.
Answer target with most score gets printed at the end, and saved into shared preferences.
User can change animation mode in settings ON/OFF - to skip calculation and other UI effects.
